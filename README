# StreamKey

[Blog Post](http://blog.giacomocerquone.com/StreamKey-stream-your-keyboard/)
StreamKey is an application to stream a keyboard of one PC to another (through websockets)

## Caveats
Two problems that StreamKey have (due to robotjs lib):
- When an application is fullscreen on windows, streamkey doesn't correctly simulate key strokes ().
- Some particular letters (with accents for example) are not pressed ().

## Installation
Give `npm install -g streamkey` on both computers.

## Usage
1a. Give `streamkey server` on the PC that hasn't a keyboard
1b. Give `streamkey client -i <local-ip-of-your-server>` on the pac that has got a keyboard
